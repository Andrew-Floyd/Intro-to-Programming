# Intro-to-Programming
Andrew Floyd - Southwest Technical College - Software Development Program

I created this repository for the Intro to Programming course so that I could save assignments on here. These assignments are important so that potential employers can see progress I have made and see what skills I have become proficient in and can assess my value off of said assignments. 

**Personal Bio**
I am currently a student studying programming. I pride myself in having good interpersonal skills and teamwork cooperation, I work well in teams of people and often contribute to discussions or ideas that may be presented.

I am taking this program due to my high interest in programming and the limitless potential that it can offer. I love creating things and programming offers that creativity to where I can build new things and continually make progress and make them better. My end goal is to work on mobile apps and even create my own for people to use freely. Once I reach that then I will set new goals for me to achieve and push my education/career even further.
